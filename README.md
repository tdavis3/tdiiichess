# TDIII Chess

TDIII Chess is a new, powerful, and aesthetic chess tournament management and pairing software. It seeks to make any tournament director's job super easy.

MERN Stack: DynamoDB, AWS SAM, React.js, Node.js

Most of the frontend components are from Material-UI (https://material-ui.com/)


Current softwares on the market, although functional, have poor UI/UX, lack cross-platform functionality, and have a large learning curve 
that typically prevents small clubs from entering rated play.
